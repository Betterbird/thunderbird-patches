# thunderbird-patches
Betterbird is a fork of Mozilla Thunderbird. Here are the patches that provide all the goodness.

## Building Betterbird
These instruction assume that you know how to build Thunderbird. The following instructions are specific to Betterbird.

1. Pull `mozilla-esr91` and `comm-esr91`.  
(The `comm-esr91` repo goes into the `mozilla-esr91/comm/` subdirectory.)
1. Put `91/series-M-C` into `mozilla-esr91/.hg/patches`; rename `series-M-C` to `series`.
1. Put `91/series` into `mozilla-esr91/comm/.hg/patches`.
1. Put all patches from `91/branding`, `91/bugs`, `91/features`, `91/misc` into `mozilla-esr91/comm/.hg/patches`,
then move the ones ending in `*-m-c.patch` into `mozilla-esr91/.hg/patches`.
1. Copy `.mozconfig` into the `mozilla-esr91` directory.
1. Apply the patches using `hg qpush -a`.
1. Build normally using `mach build`.
1. Build an installer using `mach package`.
 
Voil√†. :heavy_check_mark:

Note that our builds sometimes include patches taken from [bugzilla.mozilla.org](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) when we quick-track fixes.
We don't store those patches here. Those patches will have a comment in the series file pointing to the original changeset.

To import: `hg qimport <changeset URL> -n <patch name>.patch`.  
If you miss them, you will notice it on the `hg qpush`.

Linux users please note that [08-branding-m-c.patch](91/branding/08-branding-m-c.patch) patches a Windows installer script making use of Windows PowerShell.
However, that part of the build system should not be triggered for Linux builds.

Linux users also can use [Ansible-betterbird](https://github.com/4ch1m/ansible-betterbird) for an automated "one click" build, well, "one command" build. To build successfully on Linux, you need at least 16 GB of memory or swap space.

## Support

Read [www.betterbird.eu/support/](https://www.betterbird.eu//support/). Here is an abridged version:

1. Thunderbird has 14.000+ bugs which won't be fixed as part of Betterbird.
1. First step: Check whether the bug exists in Thunderbird. If so, check whether it has been reported at [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).
1. If the bug is also in Thunderbird, let us know that it's important to you, we'll check whether we deem it "must have" enough to fix it considering the necessary effort.
1. If the bug is only in Betterbird, let us know, we'll endeavour to fix it asap, usually within days.
1. Common sense bug reporting rules apply: Bug needs to be reproducible, user needs to cooperate in debugging.
